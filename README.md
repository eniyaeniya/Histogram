# Histogram Assignment
The assignment is to create an english letters histogram.

Two programs were created for this assignment:
1. First assignment, singleThreadHistogram - performs the histogram by a single thread.
2. Second assignment, multiThreadHistogram - performs the histogram by a multi threads (10 threads for instance).

The operating system is Linux.

Each program reads the file /usr/share/dict/words containing all the words in English, one word per line.

The output contains a histogram of the letters, i.e. a list containing the number of occurrences of each letter.

## Run:
